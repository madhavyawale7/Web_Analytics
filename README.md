PROJECT SUMMARY :

This project analysis delves into a comprehensive examination of various facets pertaining to campaign performance, visitor engagement, event analysis, user behavior, and product interactions. Firstly, it involves assessing the overall performance of campaigns conducted within a specific timeframe, including evaluating the number of campaigns conducted and their effectiveness. This evaluation is further extended by analyzing the start and end dates of each campaign to understand their duration, providing insights into campaign lifespans and scheduling efficiency.

Visitor engagement is then evaluated through the analysis of total and unique visits generated during each campaign, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of visitor interaction and engagement levels. Additionally, the average duration of campaigns is calculated to provide further insights into the typical lifespan of campaigns and their effectiveness over time. This is complemented by measuring total and unique users engaged in each campaign, along with average unique user engagement, providing a deeper understanding of user interaction and campaign reach.

Furthermore, the analysis extends to understanding event type distribution across campaigns, identifying trends or patterns in user behavior and interaction with various events. Investigating the association of products with each campaign offers insights into campaign scope and reach, aiding in optimizing marketing strategies. Performance metrics evaluation, including views, cart adds, purchases, and abandoned actions within each campaign, facilitates a comprehensive assessment of campaign effectiveness.

Conversion rate analysis allows for the calculation of conversion rates for various actions, shedding light on the effectiveness of campaigns in driving desired outcomes. Cookie ID analysis examines visitor tracking and engagement, while sequence number assessment evaluates the average sequence number of events within each campaign to understand user interactions better. Abandoned product rate investigation identifies potential areas for improvement in user experience or marketing strategy, while event volume assessment gauges overall activity.

Lastly, identifying the most frequent events and analyzing daily event distribution help prioritize areas of interest or concern, while checkout abandonment rate calculation and sequence analysis for purchases provide insights into user behavior and conversion pathways. Temporal event frequency analysis identifies temporal trends or anomalies, and ad impression performance analysis evaluates ad effectiveness. These analyses collectively offer valuable insights into campaign effectiveness, user engagement, and overall website performance, facilitating informed decision-making and optimization strategies.
